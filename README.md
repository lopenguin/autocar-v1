autocar-v1

Please see the information on my [website](https://lorenzos.me/projects/autocar). This code controls a car that moves autonomously in a single direction, avoiding large obstacles using a distance sensor. Many of the files are also intended for reuse in future projects (especially transducer_classes.h/cpp).
